        <p>
            I am a Full Stack Web Development Fellow at the Pursuit Fellowship based out of New York City. The Pursuit Fellowship is an intensive 12 month software engineering fellowship with a 9% acceptance rate and a project-based curriculum which provides experience with languages such as Javascript, CSS, and HTML. <br> </br>

I am always looking for new challenges so when I discovered code academy I was quickly enthralled in the world of coding. Only a week after I began taking courses on code academy I was already looking for how to transition into a career in technology when I learned about the Pursuit Fellowship. Since then I have been using my passion for computer science to grow as a Software Engineer. <br> </br>

Outside of software engineering, I am an avid reader of fictional novels, especially genres like fantasy and horror. Some of my favorites novels include Malazan Book of the Fallen by Steven Erikson and Ian C. Esslemont, Salems Lot and IT by Stephen King, and The Realm of the Elderlings by Robin Hobb.
