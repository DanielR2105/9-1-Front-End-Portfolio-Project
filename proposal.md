# Frontend Portfolio Project


### User Stories 
- As a user I can click on a link to an about page that will load information on the developer.
- As a user, when I visit the website I will see a search bar and a featured book of the day.
- As a user I can click on a preview to load more information on a book.
- Upon making a search the page will load the book searched for along with similar books from the same author. This will also load links for a sample of the book and where to purchase the book.
- The color and background of the page will change depending on the books genre.
- The google books api also has an embedder api that should make loading previews easier.
